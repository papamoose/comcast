Comcast
-------
[Originally written by Eric Swanson](https://github.com/lachesis/comcast) and modified to work as a python class.
It returns a hash with all data Comcast is willing to divulge.

The example script shows you how one might deal with this information
to check your quota.

The only requirement for the Python script is the requests library.

Usage
-----
```bash
COMCAST_USERNAME=bob COMCAST_PASSWORD=hope python3 example.py
```
